Feature: Mobile check deposit

  As an account holder
  I want to deposit my check through my mobile
  So that I can save time

  # Background:
  #   # Given I have an account with the branch number 12345
  #   # And Clare has an account with the branch number 12345
  #   # And the bank has issued a 10-check checkbook to Clare

  Scenario: Deposit check by number from same bank
    # Given my bank account balance is $100
    # And Clare’s bank account balance is $90
    # And Clare has written a $10 check to me
    When I deposit the check into my account
    Then my account balance should be $110
    # And Clare’s account balance should be $80
    # And Clare should have 9 checks left in her checkbook
