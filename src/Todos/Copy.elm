# Whatâ€™s it all about?

This is a boilerplate project for building front end apps with elm.

The source code and more info can be found [here](https://github.com/LikeJasper/elm-boilerplate).

The backend is yet to be written, so network requests are sent to a presumed REST API when you login or when you click "Save", but for the meantime there is no such functionality on this live site. See the repo for how to mock this functionality locally.
